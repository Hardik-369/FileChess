# FileChess
FileChess is a virtual storage system that uses steganography to embed files within a chessboard image. Users can upload, store, and retrieve various file types through an intuitive interface. Each block on the chessboard serves as a dynamic storage unit, providing a secure and visually engaging way to manage data efficiently.
